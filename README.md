The notes that are in this repository are modeled on the material covered in the following textbook: 
- [Lay/Lay/Mcdonald, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, Math 54, Second Custom Edition for UC Berkeley](https://www.amazon.com/Differential-Equations-University-California-Berkeley/dp/B009748CW8)

I am taking this class in the Spring Semester of 2024, with professor Arun Sharma! Here is the [course website!](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~asharma/Math54/)
- On this website you can find all of Professor Sharma's notes, Weekly Quizzes with their Solutions, Homeworks and their Solutions, Midterms and their Solutions, as well as Review Worksheets.

The **topics** which are covered in this class are as follows: 
- Matrix arithmetic
- Vector spaces
- Inner product spaces
- Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors
- Linear Transformations
- Symmetric Matrices
- Ordinarly differential equations
- Systems of Linear Differential Equations
- Fourier series

**Course Objectives:**  To gain a good understanding of the topics above, especially how they interrelate to each other, and being able to solve a variety of problems where these concepts could be presented in different ways.

**Prerequisites:**  Math 1B, Math 10B, or the equivalent.
