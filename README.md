- Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors
- Linear Transformations
- Symmetric Matrices
- Ordinarly differential equations
- Systems of Linear Differential Equations
- Fourier series

**Course Objectives:**  To gain a good understanding of the topics above, especially how they interrelate to each other, and being able to solve a variety of problems where these concepts could be presented in different ways.

**Prerequisites:**  Math 1B, Math 10B, or the equivalent.
